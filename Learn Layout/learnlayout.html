    <div id="main">
      div is the standard block-level element. A block-level element starts on a new line and stretches out to the left
      and
      right as far as it can. Other common block-level elements are p and form, and new in HTML5 are header, footer,
      section, and more.
    </div>

    <div class="simple">I am smaller....</div>
    <div class="fancy"> And i am bigger</div>
    <div class="static">static is the default value. An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special
      way. A static element is said to be not positioned and an element with its position set to anything else is said
      to be positioned.</div>
    <div class="relative">relative behaves the same as static unless you add some extra properties.</div>
    <div class="relative2">Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will
      cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left
      by the element.</div>
    <div class="fixed">A fixed element is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same
      place even if the page is scrolled. As with relative, the top, right, bottom, and left properties are used.</div>
